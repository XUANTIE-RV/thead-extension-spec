[#xtheadmempair-insns-lwd,reftext=Load two signed 32-bit values]
==== th.lwd

Synopsis::
Load two signed 32-bit values from memory into two GPRs.

Mnemonic::
th.lwd _rd1_, _rd2_, (_rs1_), _imm2_, 3

Encoding::
[wavedrom, , svg]
....
{reg:[
    { bits:  7, name: 0xb, attr: ['custom-0, 32 bit'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd1' },
    { bits:  3, name: 0x4, attr: ['Mem-Load'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs1' },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd2' },
    { bits:  2, name: 'imm2' },
    { bits:  5, name: 0x1c },
]}
....

Description::
This instruction loads two signed 32-bit values into the two GP registers _rd1_ and _rd2_
from the address _rs1_ + (zero_extend(_imm2_) << 3).

The encoding of this instruction with equal _rd1_, _rd2_ and _rs1_ is reserved.

Note, that there is no atomicity guarantee for this instruction.
I.e., an implementation can realize this instruction in form of two
memory transactions and an exception can be handled in-between, in which
case the whole instruction will be re-executed.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
if (rs1 != rd1 && rs != rd2 && rd1 != rd2) {
    addr := rs1 + (zero_extend(imm2) << 3)
    tmp1 := sign_extend(mem[addr+3:addr])
    tmp2 := sign_extend(mem[addr+7:addr+3])
    (reg[rd1], reg[rd2]) := (tmp1, tmp2)
}
--

Permission::
This instruction can be executed in all privilege levels.

Exceptions::
This instruction triggers the same exceptions that two corresponding `LW` instructions would trigger.
