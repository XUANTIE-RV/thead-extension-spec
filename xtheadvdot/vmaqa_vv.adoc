Description::

The four signed 8-bit elements of 32-bit of vs1 are multiplied with the four signed 8-bit elements of 32-bit of vs2 and then the four results are added together with the corresponding 32-bit element of Vd. This instruction is based on vector extension.The vector masking  operates at source operands with 8-bit element size. If vm=1, the instruction is unmasked and the instruction is vmaqa.vv vd, vs1, vs2. If vm=0, the instruction is masked and the instruction is vmaqa.vv vd, vs1, vs2, v0.t. When v0.mask[i] is 1, the multiplication result of vs1[(i+1)*8:i*8] and vs2[(i+1)*8:i*8] is added with vd.The vector length(vl)  operates at destination operands with 32-bit element size. 
Operation::
[source,sail]
--
vd[i] = vd[i] + vs1[i][7:0]   * vs2[i][7:0] 
              + vs1[i][15:8]  * vs2[i][15:8] 
              + vs1[i][23:16] * vs2[i][23:16] 
              + vs1[i][31:24] * vs2[i][31:24]

Permission::
This instruction can be executed in all privilege levels.

Exceptions::
This instruction triggers the same exceptions that a `vmacc.vv` instructions would trigger except that the value of vsew[2:0] must be 3'b010.
